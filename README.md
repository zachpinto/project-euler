## Project Euler 

This repo contains solutions for the first 100 problems of Project Euler implemented in Python. 

The repo is organized such that each directory contains 10 problems. (ie. /91-100) contains problems 91-100.

Note: Due to Project Euler's request to not have any solutions past the first 100 problems shared, I will not be including those here. My current score can be found here:
